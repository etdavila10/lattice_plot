# Weyl Alternation Diagrams for Lie Algebras of rank 2
* Based on the paper[Visualizing the support of Kostant's weight multiplicity formula for the rank-2 Lie algebras](https://msp.org/involve/2024/17-2/p01.xhtml) by [Pamela E. Harris](https://www.pamelaeharris.com/ "Pamela"),
[Eduardo Torres Davila](https://etdavila10.github.io/ "Eduardo"),
Juan Ramirez, and Fabrice O. Ulysse<sup>1</sup>

## Usage

* Example using `lattice_plot_d2.py`

`python lattice_plot_d2.py`

* The following will be prompted

```
value for n?
(has to be even)

```

* Inputing `4`

```
value for n?
(has to be even)
4
value for m?
(has to be even)
```

* Inputing `4`

```
value for n?
(has to be even)
4
value for m?
(has to be even)
4
images/d2_images/lattice_n4_m4.pdf was saved!
```

* Now the image should be saved in the created directory and the generated image
should appear on the screen.
