## Usage
* Activate the Python virtual environment (Make sure you are in the directory)

`source venv/bin/activate`

* Example using `lattice_plot_d2.py`

`python lattice_plot_d2.py`

* The following will be prompted

```
value for n?
(has to be even)

```

* Inputing `4`

```
value for n?
(has to be even)
4
value for m?
(has to be even)
```

* Inputing `4`

```
value for n?
(has to be even)
4
value for m?
(has to be even)
4
images/d2_images/lattice_n4_m4.pdf was saved!
```

* Now the image should be saved in the created directory and the generated image
should appear on the screen.
