# Weyl Alternation Diagrams for Lie Algebras of rank 2

## Usage
* Activate the Python virtual environment (Make sure you are in the directory)

`source venv/bin/activate`

* Example using `lattice_plot_d2.py`

`python lattice_plot_d2.py`

* The following will be prompted

```
value for n?
(has to be even)

```
